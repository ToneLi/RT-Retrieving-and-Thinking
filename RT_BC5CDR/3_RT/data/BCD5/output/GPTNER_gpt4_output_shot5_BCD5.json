{"sentence": "Crocin improves lipid dysregulation in subacute diazinon exposure through ERK1/2 pathway in rat liver. INTRODUCTION: Diazinon Yis one of the most broadly used organophosphorus insecticides in agriculture. It has been shown that exposure to diazinon may interfere with lipid metabolism. Moreover, the hypolipidemic effect of crocin has been established. Earlier studies revealed the major role of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) expression. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the regulation of lipid metabolism, ERK and LDLr expression in the liver of rats exposed to subacute diazinon . Furthermore ameliorating effect of crocin on diazinon induced disturbed cholesterol homeostasis was studied. METHODS: 24 Rats were divided into 4 groups and received following treatments for 4 weeks; Corn oil (control), diazinon (15mg/kg per day, orally) and crocin (12.5 and 25mg/kg per day, intraperitoneally) in combination with diazinon (15 mg/kg). The levels of cholesterol , triglyceride and LDL in blood of rats were analyzed.

{"sentence": "Characterization of a novel BCHE \"silent\" allele: point mutation (p.Val204Asp) causes loss of activity and prolonged apnea with suxamethonium . Butyrylcholinesterase deficiency is characterized by prolonged apnea after the use of muscle relaxants ( suxamethonium or mivacurium ) in patients who have mutations in the BCHE gene. Here, we report a case of prolonged neuromuscular block after administration of suxamethonium leading to the discovery of a novel BCHE variant (c.695T>A, p.Val204Asp). Inhibition studies, kinetic analysis and molecular dynamics were undertaken to understand how this mutation disrupts the catalytic triad and determines a \"silent\" phenotype. Low activity of patient plasma butyrylcholinesterase with butyrylthiocholine ( BTC ) and benzoylcholine , and values of dibucaine and fluoride numbers fit with heterozygous atypical silent genotype. Electrophoretic analysis of plasma BChE of the proband and his mother showed that patient has a reduced amount of tetrameric enzyme in plasma and that minor fast-moving BChE components: monomer, dimer, and monomer-albumin conjugate are missing.

Patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation are generally immunosuppressed with a dose of cyclophosphamide ( CYA ) which is usually calculated based on the patient's weight. At these high doses of CYA , serious cardiotoxicity may occur, but definitive risk factors for the development of such cardiotoxicity have not been described. Since chemotherapeutic agent toxicity generally correlates with dose per body surface area, we retrospectively calculated the dose of CYA in patients transplanted at our institution to determine whether the incidence of CYA  cardiotoxicity correlated with the dose per body surface area. Eighty patients who were to receive CYA 50 mg/kg/d for four days as preparation for marrow grafting underwent a total of 84 transplants for aplastic anemia , Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome , or severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome . Fourteen of 84 (17%) patients had symptoms and signs consistent with CYA  cardiotoxicity within ten days of receiving 1 to 4 doses of CYA . Six of the 14 patients died with congestive heart failure . The dose of CYA per body surface area was calculated for all patients and the patients were divided into two groups based on daily CYA dose: Group 1, CYA less than or equal to 1.55 g/m2/d; Group 2, CYA greater than 1.55 g/m2/d. Cardiotoxicity that was thought to be related to CYA occurred in 1/32 (3%) of patients in Group 1 and in 13/52 (25%) patients in Group 2 (P less than 0.025). Congestive heart failure caused or contributed to death in 0/32 patients in Group 1 v 6/52 (12%) of patients in Group 2 (P less than 0.25). There was no difference in the rate of engraftment of evaluable patients in the two groups (P greater than 0.5). We conclude that the CYA  cardiotoxicity correlates with CYA dosage as calculated by body surface area, and that patients with aplastic anemia and immunodeficiencies can be effectively prepared for bone marrow grafting at a CYA dose of 1.55 g/m2/d for four days with a lower incidence of cardiotoxicity than patients whose CYA dosage is calculated based on weight.

BACKGROUND: The use of appetite suppressants in Europe has been associated with the development of primary pulmonary hypertension ( PPH ). Recently, fenfluramine appetite suppressants became widely used in the United States but were withdrawn in September 1997 because of concerns over adverse effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective surveillance study on patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at 12 large referral centers in North America. Data collected on patients seen from September 1, 1996, to December 31, 1997, included the cause of the pulmonary hypertension and its severity. Patients with no identifiable cause of pulmonary hypertension were classed as PPH . A history of drug exposure also was taken with special attention on the use of antidepressants, anorexigens, and amphetamines . RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-nine patients were studied, 205 with PPH and 374 with pulmonary hypertension from other causes (secondary pulmonary hypertension [SPH]). The use of anorexigens was common in both groups.

A total of 115 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder , manic or mixed, were randomized to olanzapine , 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 55), or placebo (n = 60). The primary efficacy measure was the Young- Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) total score.

BACKGROUND: This study examined the role of phase 2 early afterdepolarization (EAD) in producing a trigger to initiate torsade de pointes ( TdP ) with QT prolongation induced by dl- sotalol and azimilide . The contribution of transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) to transmural propagation of EAD and the maintenance of TdP was also evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Transmembrane action potentials from epicardium, midmyocardium, and endocardium were recorded simultaneously, together with a transmural ECG, in arterially perfused canine and rabbit left ventricular preparations. dl- Sotalol preferentially prolonged action potential duration (APD) in M cells dose-dependently (1 to 100 micromol/L), leading to QT prolongation and an increase in TDR. Azimilide , however, significantly prolonged APD and QT interval at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 micromol/L but shortened them at 30 micromol/L. Unlike dl- sotalol , azimilide (>3 micromol/L) increased epicardial APD markedly, causing a diminished TDR. Although both dl- sotalol and azimilide rarely induced EADs in canine left ventricles, they produced frequent EADs in rabbits, in which more pronounced QT prolongation was seen. An increase in TDR by dl- sotalol facilitated transmural propagation of EADs that initiated multiple episodes of spontaneous TdP in 3 of 6 rabbit left ventricles. Of note, although azimilide (3 to 10 micromol/L) increased APD more than dl- sotalol , its EADs often failed to propagate transmurally, probably because of a diminished TDR.

In a previous phase II study with 3-weekly bolus 5-FU , FA and mitomycin C ( MMC ) we found a low toxicity rate and response rates comparable to those of regimens such as ELF, FAM or FAMTX, and a promising median overall survival. In order to improve this MMC -dependent schedule we initiated a phase II study with high-dose 5-FU / FA and 3-weekly bolus MMC . PATIENTS AND METHODS: From February, 1998 to September, 2000 we recruited 33 patients with AGC to receive weekly 24-hour 5-FU 2,600 mg/m(2) preceded by 2-hour FA 500 mg/m(2) for 6 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period. Bolus MMC 10 mg/m(2) was added in 3-weekly intervals. Treatment given on an outpatient basis, using portable pump systems, was repeated on day 57. Patients' characteristics were: male/female ratio 20/13; median age 57 (27-75) years; median WHO status 1 (0-2). 18 patients had a primary AGC , and 15 showed a relapsed AGC . Median follow-up was 11.8 months (range of those surviving: 2.7-11.8 months). RESULTS: 32 patients were evaluable for response - complete remission 9.1% (n = 3), partial remission 45.5% (n = 15), no change 27.3% (n = 9), progressive disease 15.1% (n = 5). Median overall survival time was 10.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 8.7-11.6], and median progression-free survival time was 7.6 months (95% CI: 4.4-10.9).

{"sentence": "Carvedilol protects against doxorubicin -induced mitochondrial cardiomyopathy . Several cytopathic mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the dose-limiting cumulative and irreversible cardiomyopathy caused by doxorubicin . Recent evidence indicates that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are key factors in the pathogenic process. The objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that carvedilol , a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with potent antioxidant properties, protects against the cardiac and hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction associated with subchronic doxorubicin  toxicity . Heart and liver mitochondria were isolated from rats treated for 7 weeks with doxorubicin (2 mg/kg sc/week), carvedilol (1 mg/kg ip/week), or the combination of the two drugs. Heart mitochondria isolated from doxorubicin -treated rats exhibited depressed rates for state 3 respiration (336 +/- 26 versus 425 +/- 53 natom O/min/mg protein) and a lower respiratory control ratio (RCR) (4.3 +/- 0.6 versus 5.8 +/- 0.4) compared with cardiac mitochondria isolated from saline-treated rats. Mitochondrial calcium -loading capacity and the activity of NADH-dehydrogenase were also suppressed in cardiac mitochondria from doxorubicin -treated rats. Doxorubicin treatment also caused a decrease in RCR for liver mitochondria (3.9 +/- 0.9 versus 5.6 +/- 0.7 for control rats) and inhibition of hepatic cytochrome oxidase activity. Coadministration of carvedilol decreased the extent of cellular vacuolization in cardiac myocytes and prevented the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin on mitochondrial respiration in both heart and liver.

BACKGROUND: Combined hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) and lamivudine in prophylaxis of the recurrence of hepatitis B after liver transplantation has significantly improved the survival of HBsAg positive patients. This study was undertaken to evaluate the outcomes of liver transplantation for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV). METHODS: A retrospective chart analysis and a review of the organ transplant database identified 51 patients (43 men and 8 women) transplanted for benign HBV-related cirrhotic diseases between June 2002 and December 2004 who had survived more than 3 months. HBIg was administered intravenously during the first week and intramuscularly thereafter. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 14.1 months, the overall recurrence rate in the 51 patients was 3.9% (2/51). The overall patient survival was 88.3%, and 82.4% after 1 and 2 years, respectively.

BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Undersized mitral annuloplasty (MAP) is effective in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and functional mitral regurgitation ( MR ) since, as well as addressing the MR , the MAP may also reshape the dilated left ventricular (LV) base. However, the direct benefits of this possible reshaping on LV function in the absence of underlying MR remain incompletely understood. The study aim was to identify these benefits in a canine model of acute heart failure . METHODS: Six dogs underwent MAP with a prosthetic band on the posterior mitral annulus, using four mattress sutures. The sutures were passed individually through four tourniquets and exteriorized untied via the left atriotomy. Sonomicrometry crystals were implanted around the mitral annulus and left ventricle to measure geometry and regional function. Acute heart failure was induced by propranolol and volume loading after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass; an absence of MR was confirmed by echocardiography. MAP was accomplished by cinching the tourniquets. Data were acquired at baseline, after induction of acute heart failure , and after MAP. RESULTS: MAP decreased mitral annular dimensions in both commissure-commissure and septal-lateral directions. Concomitantly, the diastolic diameter of the LV base and LV sphericity decreased (i.e., improved) from 37.4 +/- 9.3 to 35.9 +/- 10 mm (p = 0.063), and from 67.9 +/- 18.6% to 65.3 +/- 18.9% (p = 0.016), respectively.

Temporary ipsilateral vocal nerve palsies due to local anesthetics have been described, however. Such complications are most important in situations where there is a pre-existing contralateral paralysis . We therefore examined the effect of local anesthesia on vocal cord function to better understand its possible consequences. METHODS: This prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia. Vocal cord function was evaluated before, during, and after surgery (postoperative day 1) using flexible laryngoscopy. Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long-acting ( ropivacaine ) and short-acting ( prilocaine ) anesthetic. RESULTS: All patients had normal vocal cord function preoperatively. Twelve patients (43%) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis . It resolved in all cases < or =24 hours. There were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary vocal cord paralysis compared with those without. CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in almost half of these patients.

Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long-acting ( </C>ropivacaine<C> ) and short-acting ( </C>prilocaine<C> ) anesthetic. RESULTS: All patients had normal vocal cord function preoperatively. Twelve patients (43%) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis . It resolved in all cases < or =24 hours. There were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary vocal cord paralysis compared with those without. CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in almost half of these patients. Because pre-existing paralysis is of a relevant frequency (up to 3%), a preoperative evaluation of vocal cord function before carotid </D>endarterectomy<D> under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative bilateral paralysis . In patients with preoperative contralateral vocal cord paralysis", "gold_labels": "O O O O Disease Disease Disease O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O Disease Disease Disease O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O Disease O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O Chemical O O O O Chemical O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O Disease Disease Disease O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O Disease Disease Disease O O O O O O O O O O O Disease Disease Disease O O O O O O O O Disease O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O Disease O O O O O O Disease Disease Disease"}

{"sentence": "Neuropsychiatric behaviors in the MPTP marmoset model of Parkinson's disease . OBJECTIVES: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are increasingly recognised as a significant problem in patients with Parkinson's disease ( PD ). These symptoms may be due to 'sensitisation' following repeated levodopa treatment or a direct effect of dopamine on the disease state. The levodopa -treated MPTP -lesioned marmoset was used as a model of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD patients. Here we compare the time course of levodopa -induced motor fluctuations and neuropsychiatric-like behaviors to determine the relationship between duration of treatment and onset of symptoms. METHODS: Marmosets were administered 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (2.0 mg/kg s.c.) for five days, resulting in stable parkinsonism . Levodopa (15 mg/kg and benserazide , 3.75 mg/kg) p.o. b.i.d, was administered for 30 days. Animals were evaluated for parkinsonian disability , dyskinesia and on-time (motor fluctuations) and neuropsychiatric-like behaviors on Day 0 (prior to levodopa ) and on Days 1, 7, 13, 27 and 30 of treatment using post hoc DVD analysis by a trained rater, blind to the treatment day. RESULTS: The neuropsychiatric-like behavior rating scale demonstrated high interrater reliability between three trained raters of differing professional backgrounds. As anticipated, animals exhibited a progressive increase in levodopa -induced motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and wearing-off, that correlated with the duration of levodopa therapy. In contrast, levodopa -induced neuropsychiatric-like behaviors were present on Day 1 of levodopa treatment and their severity did not correlate with duration of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that neuropsychiatric disorders in PD are more likely an interaction between levodopa", "pre_labels": "Neuropsychiatric behaviors in the MPTP marmoset model of Parkinson\"s disease .

{"sentence": "Contrast medium  nephrotoxicity after renal artery and coronary angioplasty. BACKGROUND: Renal dysfunction induced by iodinated contrast medium ( CM ) administration can minimize the benefit of the interventional procedure in patients undergoing renal angioplasty (PTRA). PURPOSE: To compare the susceptibility to nephrotoxic effect of CM in patients undergoing PTRA with that of patients submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients successfully treated with PTRA (PTRA group, mean age 70+/-12 years, 23 female, basal creatinine 1.46+/-0.79, range 0.7-4.9 mg/dl) were compared with 33 patients undergoing successful PCI (PCI group), matched for basal creatinine (1.44+/-0.6, range 0.7-3.4 mg/dl), gender, and age. In both groups postprocedural (48 h) serum creatinine was measured. RESULTS: Postprocedural creatinine level decreased nonsignificantly in the PTRA group (1.46+/-0.8 vs. 1.34+/-0.5 mg/dl, P=NS) and increased significantly in the PCI group (1.44+/-0.6 vs. 1.57+/-0.7 mg/dl, P<0.02). Changes in serum creatinine after intervention (after-before) were significantly different between the PTRA and PCI groups (-0.12+/-0.5 vs. 0.13+/-0.3, P=0.014). This difference was not related to either a different clinical risk profile or to the volume of CM administered.
