## How far is Language Model from 100% Few-shot Named Entity Recognition in Medical Domain
This is the source code of the model RT (Retrieving and Thinking). For the full project, please check the file RT_BC5CDR/3_RT and RT_NCBI/3_RT, the implementation of GPT-NER  and PromptNER is in the BC5CDR.zip and NCBI.zip.
we refer to the source of [code of GPT-NER](https://github.com/ShuheWang1998/GPT-NER) [paper of GPT-NER ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10428) in our project and the implementation of GPT-NER.

### 1) Overview

The architecture of our proposed RT is depicted in the diagram below.   It consists of three major parts:
